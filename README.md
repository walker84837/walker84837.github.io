# Walker \#84837's Linktree

This is the GitHub repo for my Linktree page, based on [John
Emerson](https://github.com/johnggli)'s Linktree page[^1]. Aside from
everything, there is nothing much to say about this repo.

[^1]: I didn't know about licenses back when I personalized this website, and
I forgot who originally made this. After that, I checked GitHub and saw it was
an MIT License, so I just added credits and changed the license to MIT.
